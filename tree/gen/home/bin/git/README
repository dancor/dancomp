- how to set up

# in .bashrc:
# to get scripts:
export PATH="$PATH":"$ADMIN_SCRIPTS":"$ADMIN_SCRIPTS"/git
# to get git branch prompt displayed in bash prompt:
#<TODO: add this>

# at prompt, just need to do one-time
#   (or repeat if there is ish that could be due to new changes):
# to get aliases:
cp "$ADMIN_SCRIPTS"/sample.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig


- the sample .gitconfig is at "$ADMIN_SCRIPTS"/sample.gitconfig
  see that for reference on the extreme-shortcut versions of these commands

- example usage (this is my workflow all the time)

~ # go to our repo dir
~ cd ~/www

~ # lets see what branches we have
~ g ab
  log_img
* master
  tc
  test

~ # let's go into my tc branch (traccamp) and see what's up there
~ g b tc
Switched to branch "tc"
on branch tc
# On branch tc
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
Switched to branch "master"
Current branch master is up to date.
Switched to branch "tc"
Already up-to-date.
