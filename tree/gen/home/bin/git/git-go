# - take one or more checkpoint changes on branch $br (current if unspecified)
# - squash merge them into single commit in "$br"-READY
#   - at this time you edit the commit template with comments and test plan
# - review the commit message and diff for mailing to reviewers
# - optionally send the diff mail
#
# after review comes back, just run gsd from master and you are done
# or, if you need to:
# - make any local modifications, if needed
# - gmm to add those changes to the commit and/or modify the commit message
# - use gmd to re-{review,mail} diff, and so on
